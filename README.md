# Blueprint-Project: Better Books

*The reading app of the future!*

Better Books is an app to help avid readers find the perfect book for their next read. Gone are the days of endlessly searching for a book to hold your interest. With Better Books, that literary adventure is accessible at the tips of your fingers in mere seconds. Designed as a simpler & more streamlined version of Goodreads, Better Books uses an algorithm to cross-references your favorite books with similar readersâ€™ preferences to find the best possible book for you to read next. 

How it Works: The algorithm looks for users with 4 matching favorite books & returns the 5th!
